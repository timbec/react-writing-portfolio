Writing Portfolio built with Next.js is a React.js framework, allowing for server-side rendering (and thus better SEO - content can be indexed by Google)

This takes data from my writing portfolio at https://timbeckett-writing.com and will sort by category into sections (Fiction, Non-Fiction etc). The idea is to start simple and build as I go.
